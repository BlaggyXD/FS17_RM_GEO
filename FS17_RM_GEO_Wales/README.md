Seasons GEO mod for Wales
=========================

Weather is created by reallogger. The same weather can be found in the Churn Valley map by ccs101

This is an example GEO mod, for creating a weather and growth experience similar to any place on earth.
(As long as this place is above the equator)

*Note*: We want to keep the `FS17_RM_` prefix for our own mods. (RM stands for Realismus Modding). If you
make your own mod and want to publish it, please use another name.
