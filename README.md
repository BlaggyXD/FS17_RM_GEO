A repository of all GEO mods. If you wish to test them, then you need to download the zip file, unzip it, and zip each subfolder as a separate mod before placing the zip files in your mods directory. If you cannot follow these instructions, then wait for the GEO mod to be available on Giants modhub.

Note that only one GEO mod can be active in a savegame.

### Wales

Weather is created by reallogger. The same weather can be found in the Churn Valley map by ccs101

### U.S. Midwest

This GEO mod simulates weather and growth in the U.S. Midwest.
The weather is based on historical data from Princeton Missouri

### Central France

This GEO mod simulates weather and growth in Central France.
The weather is based on historical data from Orleans, France

### Northern Sweden

This is an example GEO mod, for creating a weather and growth experience similar to any place on earth.
(As long as this place is above the equator)

### Estancie Lapacho

*NOTE*: This map is is on the southern hemisphere. The GrowthTransitions are season based, and thus:

### Snowy Lands

Play like you are on holiday in a snowy winterland! Snow almost everyday, no growth at all.
